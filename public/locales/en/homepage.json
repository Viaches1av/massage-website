    "description": "My name is Viktor Vilkhov, and I truly love my work! Every day, I help people relieve pain, stress, and tension, restoring their health and lightness. For me, this is not just a profession but a true calling. Seeing the happy faces of clients after a session is the greatest reward for me.\n\nI graduated from a massage course at a medical college in Ukraine, where my teacher was a professor of medical sciences. I constantly improve my skills and learn new techniques. Today, I possess knowledge of trigger points, manual therapy techniques, joint and soft tissue mobilization, cupping massage, and kinesiotaping. Over six years of practice, I have developed my own unique massage method, combining classic and therapeutic techniques with an individualized approach to every client.\n\nI have extensive experience working with various clients: restoring mobility after injuries and surgeries, quickly relieving back, head, and limb pain. My clients often say they feel like they’re \"flying\" after a session. Even one session is enough to feel better — both physically and emotionally.\n\nOver the years, more than two thousand people have entrusted me with their health. Recently, I began sharing my knowledge with students so that even more people can experience the benefits of massage. If you want to restore your lightness, comfort, and joy of movement, book a session today. Your health is in good hands!"
